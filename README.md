Change in state must be done by the component holding the state and not the one which recieves them as props. Props should be treated as immutable and if change is needed, the child component should notify its parent. By this, all required changes in the related components are done properly. Figuing out where the state should be defined must be done properly, keeping in mind, if there is a change, it must reach wherever it is required
